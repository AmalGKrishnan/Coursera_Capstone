    "Every year the lives of approximately 1.35 million people are cut short as a result of a road traffic crash. Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability as a result of their injury.Road traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families, and to nations as a whole. These losses arise from the cost of treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries, and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product.The study of influencing factors of traffic accidents is an important research direction in the field of traffic safety. The increasing number of crashes is a major public safety concern with various related costs. "

    "This project will utilize Jupyter Notebooks to analyze a metadata set containing a rating of accident severity, street location, collision address type, weather condition, road condition, vehicle count, injuries, fatalities, and whether the driver at fault was under the influence. The dataset we will use in this project is the shared data originally provided by Seattle Department of Transportation(SDOT) Traffic Management Division, Traffic Records Group, and modified to particularly meet the project criteria.The dataset that we will be using is a .csv file named, 'Data-Collisions'. Our target variable will be 'SEVERITYCODE' because it is used to measure the severity of an accident from 0 to 3 (including a \"2b\", as per the metadata) within the dataset. Attributes that are used here to weigh the severity of an accident are 'WEATHER', 'ROADCOND' and 'LIGHTCOND'. The entire dataset originally had 194,673 rows (Instances) and 38 columns (Features). The metadata of the dataset can be found <a href=\"https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Metadata.pdf\">here</a>. <br><br>In it's original form, this data is not fit for analysis. There are many columns that we will not use for this model. So, the data is to be cleaned, preprocessed and well prepared for analysis, and then to be fed to the Machine Learning Algorithms to finalize our model.\n",
